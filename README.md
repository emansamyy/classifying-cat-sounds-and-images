# classifying-cat-sounds-and-images
python code for classifying classes of emotions that belong to cats based on audio and image files.
there are separate python files for the image model and the audio model

Audio model classifies 10 classes of cat emotions while the image model classifies only 6 of those emotions, as classifying some emotions of cats using images does not make sense.

the combine.py file runs both models and decides if the prediction matches
